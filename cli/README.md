# Parra CLI

The Parra CLI is a command line utility for bootstrapping and managing Parra projects. It is the easiest way to get started with a new project in the Parra ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Parra CLI with `brew install parra-inc/parra/parra-cli`. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).
2. Run `parra bootstrap` to start building your app. This will guide you through the process of creating a new Parra project or selecting one that already exists. See the [Parra documentation](https://docs.parra.io/guides/cli) for more information on how to use the CLI or run `parra bootstrap --help` for a list of available options.
