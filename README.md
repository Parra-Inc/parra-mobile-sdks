The Parra iOS SDK allows you to quickly and easily collect valuable product feedback data from your users. We provide customizable UI elements that blend right in with your app's design allowing for a first party look and experience.

## Requirements

The Parra iOS SDK can be built using Xcode 15.4 or later and can be installed in apps targetting iOS 17.0 or greater.

## Getting Started

If you're ready to install the Parra iOS SDK in your own project, check out the [iOS SDK integration guide](https://docs.parra.io/guides/ios). If you'd like to see Parra in action, clone this repo and run the [Demo target](https://github.com/Parra-Inc/parra-mobile-sdks/tree/main/Demo) in the included Xcode project. There you can find examples of how to customize and add Parra Feedbacks in your app.
