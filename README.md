# Parra iOS SDK

Parra is a suite of products that are designed to work together out of the box, saving you from integrating similar products manually. We offer drop-in UI components that can adapt to your app's theme, and a powerful CLI interface for generating new projects with all our available features pre-integrated.

## Getting Started

If you're creating a new project and want to start with Parra, the easiest way to do this is with the Parra CLI. We'll walk you through this in our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.parra.io/sdks/ios/quickstart). If you'd like to add Parra to your existing project, follow our [integration guide](https://docs.parra.io/sdks/ios/integration).

If you're like to give Parra's features a try before you start your project, you can download our [Demo App](https://parra.io/demo-app) from [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3xDahm6v). You can also clone this project and run the development app in the `sample` directory for the same experience locally. In both these apps, you will find complete examples of how you can customize Parra and uses its many features in your own apps.
