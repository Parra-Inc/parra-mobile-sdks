/// This example shows how you can use your own custom logic for determining how
/// and when to present a Parra Feedback Form. The steps to achieve this are:
///
/// 1. Create an `@State` variable to control the presentation state of the
///    roadmap.
/// 2. Pass the `isPresented` binding to the `presentParraRoadmap` modifier.
/// 3. When you're ready to present the roadmap, update the value of
///    `isPresented` to `true`. The roadmap will be fetched and
///    presented automatically.
struct RoadmapSample: View {
    @State var isPresented = false // #1

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Fetch and present roadmap") {
                isPresented = true // #3
            }
        }
        .presentParraRoadmap(
            isPresented: $isPresented // #2
        )
    }
}
